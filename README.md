## statement of problem
Returns the Boolean value of the statement “the maze is navigable, having a legal
travel path that is continuous from starting location to existing treasure”

legal meaning:
- do not cross the walls
- right-angle turns only
- a path cannot go through the same point twice

## recursive abstraction
When I am asked for a legal travel path that is continuous from starting location to existing treasure with n choices, the recursive abstraction can find a legal travel path with n-1 choices.
